## üìú Project Overview

The Asana Integration app provides Rocket.Chat with seamless connectivity to the Asana work management platform. This app allows teams to interact directly with Asana from within Rocket.Chat, offering real-time task notifications, quick commands, and deep linking to make project management more efficient.

Key features:

- View and manage Asana tasks within Rocket.Chat
- Receive real-time updates and notifications for Asana tasks
- Use slash commands to quickly query and manage tasks
- Associate Rocket.Chat rooms with Asana projects
- Complete project management tasks without switching applications

## üßë‚Äçüíª Mentor
Special thanks to **Gustavo Bauer** for his guidance and support throughout this project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A set-up Rocket.Chat server
- Rocket.Chat.Apps CLI tool

If you haven't installed the CLI tool yet, run:
```sh
npm install -g @rocket.chat/apps-cli
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ZilongXue/Apps.Asana.Bridge.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm ci
   ```

3. Deploy the app to your Rocket.Chat server
   ```sh
   rc-apps deploy --url <rocket-chat-url> --username <admin-username> --password <admin-password>
   ```

4. After deployment, go to the "Installed Apps" section in the Rocket.Chat admin interface and configure the following required settings:

   ```
   # Asana Client ID
   # Asana Client Secret
   # Asana Redirect URI
   # Asana Webhook Secret
   ```

   These credentials can be obtained from the [Asana Developer Console](https://app.asana.com/0/developer-console). You need to create an OAuth application in Asana and configure permissions.

5. After configuration, save the changes. Make sure to add the Rocket.Chat OAuth callback URL as an authorized redirect URI in the Asana Developer Console.

## üìã Usage

After installation, users can interact with Asana using slash commands:

```
